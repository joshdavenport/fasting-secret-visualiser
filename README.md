# Fasting Secret Visualisor

This little tool parses the output and creates a nice little heatmap to get you better visualisation of your fasts.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
1. `npm install`
1. Add exported data to data/ folder in a file named export.csv
1. Either `npm run start` or `npm run build` and view index.html in dist/
